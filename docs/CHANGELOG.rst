Changelog
=========


1.0.4 (2017-08-29)
------------------

- Improve log handling:

  * only log errors during startup
  * log INFO to stdout
  * log ERROR to stderr
  * log to instance's event.log too

  This makes it possible to only escalate errors in cronjobs, send
  normal logging to /dev/null and protocol what has been done in
  the instance.log
